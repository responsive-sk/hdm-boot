# Disabled CakePHP Database Implementation

This directory contains CakePHP database implementation files that have been temporarily disabled during the database module refactoring.

## Files moved here:
- `CakePHPDatabaseManager.php` - CakePHP Database Manager implementation
- `DatabaseConnectionManager.php` - CakePHP Database Connection Manager

## Reason for disabling:
The database module was refactored to use only PDO implementation. CakePHP implementation was causing complexity and mixing of different database abstraction approaches.

## Future plans:
These files can be:
1. Moved to a separate `Database-CakePHP` module if CakePHP support is needed
2. Deleted if CakePHP support is no longer required
3. Re-integrated if the architecture changes

## Date: 2025-06-28
## Refactored by: HDM Boot Team
