# Web Interface Demo

Welcome to the **MVA Bootstrap Web Interface Demo**! This page demonstrates how our Orbit-style content management system works in a real web application.

## 🎯 What You're Seeing

This blog interface is powered by:

- **📝 File-based storage** - This article is stored as a Markdown file with YAML front-matter
- **🗄️ Multi-database architecture** - User data, admin logs, and cache stored in separate SQLite databases
- **⚡ High performance** - Fast file-based queries with intelligent caching
- **🔍 Rich querying** - Categories, tags, search, and filtering capabilities

## 🏗️ Architecture in Action

### File Storage
```
content/articles/web-interface-demo.md
```

This very article you're reading is stored as a simple Markdown file with metadata in the YAML front-matter. It's **Git-friendly**, **human-readable**, and **version-controllable**.

### Database Storage
```
var/orbit/
├── app.db      # Application users and sessions
├── mark.db     # Admin users and audit logs
├── cache.db    # Performance optimization
└── analytics.db # Metrics and reporting
```

User data, admin operations, and performance metrics are stored in separate SQLite databases for optimal performance and security isolation.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

This demo showcases several key technical concepts:

### Orbit-Style API
```php
// Query articles (just like Laravel Orbit!)
$articles = Article::published();
$featured = Article::featured();
$byCategory = Article::byCategory('demo');
$byTag = Article::byTag('web');
```

### Multi-Database Architecture
```php
// Different models use different databases
AppUser::setDatabase('app');      // app.db
MarkUser::setDatabase('mark');    // mark.db
CacheEntry::setDatabase('cache'); // cache.db
```

### Hybrid Storage Benefits
- **Content in Files** - Git-friendly, human-readable
- **Data in Databases** - ACID transactions, relations
- **Best of Both Worlds** - Right tool for right job

2. **Check the Admin** - Visit the admin interface to see content management
3. **View the Source** - All code is available in the repository
